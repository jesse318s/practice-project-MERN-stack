## _**PLEASE READ THIS TO COMPLETION BEFORE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS!**_

### _**IMPORTANT NOTES**_ - 
This project does not have a mongoDB connection setup.
- local development: create a .env file (make sure to name it .env), which exports your MONGO_URL connection. This file will be ignored by git so your db credentials will be kept safe when the app is deployed.


## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application for heroku deployment with a solid file structure as a foundation.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root.

For more information on deploying to heroku reference the extra resources at the bottom of this file.


### `yarn workspace server build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
